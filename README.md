Designed and developed a secure and responsive web-based platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js to streamline organ donor registration and recipient management. The website facilitates communication between donors, recipients, and hospitals while ensuring data privacy through authentication and encryption. Core functionalities include online donor/recipient registration, real-time notifications for organ availability, and an admin portal for hospitals to manage transplant cases. The platform also features educational resources such as FAQs and success stories to raise awareness and address common myths. Emphasis was placed on clean UI design, accessibility, modular structure, and compliance with national organ donation regulations.
